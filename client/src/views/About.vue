      <br><br> Functionalities:

      <br>3. Want to begin exercising? Go to the Post-A-Workout tab to be able to input data about specified workouts and hit POST on their respective cards.
      <br>4. Then your workout will be posted on the tracked page where you can like and comment on your hard work!

      <br>6. Follow other users using the friend component on the tracked screen! They need to follow you back in order for you to see them on the friends tab.
      <br>7. You can also see your most recent followers posts on the tracked screen! (Tried fiddling around to be able to see all followers but couldn't make it work unfortunately)
      <br><br>Have fun! and thanks for trying out the app!
